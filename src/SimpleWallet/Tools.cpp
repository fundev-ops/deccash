        /* We want to format our number with comma separators so it's easier to
       use. Now, we could use the nice print_money() function to do this.
       However, whilst this initially looks pretty handy, if we have a locale
       such as ja_JP.utf8, 1 TRTL will actually be formatted as 100 TRTL, which
       is terrible, and could really screw over users.

       So, easy solution right? Just use en_US.utf8! Sure, it's not very
       international, but it'll work! Unfortunately, no. The user has to have
       the locale installed, and if they don't, we get a nasty error at
       runtime.

       Annoyingly, there's no easy way to comma separate numbers outside of
       using the locale method, without writing a pretty long boiler plate
       function. So, instead, we define our own locale, which just returns
       the values we want.
       
       It's less internationally friendly than we would potentially like
       but that would require a ton of scrutinization which if not done could
       land us with quite a few issues and rightfully angry users.
       Furthermore, we'd still have to hack around cases like JP locale
       formatting things incorrectly, and it makes reading in inputs harder
       too. */
